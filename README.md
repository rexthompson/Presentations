# Presentations and Papers

This repository contains several publications I have created over the years for conferences, work, class projects, etc. It is meant to showcase the level of quality I bring to projects of all types, with a special emphasis on presentations and written works. It includes examples from many older projects and projects that did not really deserve their own repositories.
